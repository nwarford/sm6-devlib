Summary: ReadMe file for SitemasonÂ® Library (PHP)
Version: 6.0.x
	  
The Sitemason Library provides classes to organize the data output of the Sitemason CMS into 
various objects.  The versioning scheme is:

[major version].[minor version].[revision]

The Major version is intended to correlate to the major version of Sitemason CMS that this
library was written for.  The minor version signifies the release of this library.  Minor
version updates could incorporate backwards-incompatible changes that will require Site Template
code updates in order to use that version of this library.  Please refer to the "Version Notes"
section of this ReadMe file for details on such changes.

Revisions will indicate backwards-compatible updates made from time to time to further improve
the library or provide bug fixes.
